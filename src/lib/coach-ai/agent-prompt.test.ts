/**
 * Regression tests for Cal's system prompt — load-bearing rules that
 * have been deleted-by-refactor in the past and immediately produced
 * coach-visible breakage.
 *
 * Surfaced 2026-05-20: a coach pasted a Reddit question about defending
 * the Double Wing and Cal replied "this is outside my wheelhouse" /
 * "this is a coaching forum discussion topic" while telling the coach
 * to "call `search_kb` with queries like..." Two bugs stacked:
 *   (a) Rule 8z's in-scope list didn't explicitly include strategic /
 *       scouting / scheme-advising questions, so Cal refused;
 *   (b) no rule forbade exposing internal tool names to the user, so
 *       Cal told the coach to invoke search_kb (which the coach has
 *       no way to do).
 *
 * These tests guard the prompt content. They CANNOT verify Cal's
 * behavior end-to-end (that needs an LLM in the loop), but they catch
 * regressions where someone deletes a rule and Cal silently reverts.
